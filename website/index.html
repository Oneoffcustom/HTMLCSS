	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I attended MMI for motorcycle repair, graduating in 1999. I became a technician for Harley Davidson working on motorcycle repair from 2000-2017. During my time as a technician I expanded my skills into motorcycle diagnostics, electrical repair, drivelines, suspension, hydrolics and powertrain. I spent time as a service writer gaining more skills in the motorcycle field. Selling, warrenty replacements, billing, rentals, parts and completing the work orders for the technicians. In 2008 I became an instructer for motorcycle repair, teaching others the skills I learned in school and through hands on experience. In 2011 I began working in the manufacturing of motorcycle seats. I began in production and finished as a sales representative. After returning to the technician field in 2014, my thirst for knowledge guided me in a new direction. I am currently taking courses in the IT and CNC fields. Through my work experience, Customer service skills have expanded greatly and are one of my best assets. With having to listen to others, problem solving, teaching and learning, I have learned to relate to a wide variety of people and problems. </p>
